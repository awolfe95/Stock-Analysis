# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project is to help Steve understand which stocks are the highest performing by creating a tool that can quickly analyze stock performance indicators. Specifically, this tool can analyze multiple stocks to understand their annual trade volumes as well rates of return.  

## Results

### 2017 vs. 2018 Stock Performance

#### In 2017, most of the stocks had positive rates of return, except for TERP. In 2018, almost the opposite occurred where all but two stocks (ENPH and RUN) had negative rates of return. This means that overall, the market for these stocks was better in 2017 compared to 2018. 


### Original vs. Refactored Code Execution Time Comparison

#### For both years, the original code took approximately .28 seconds to run, and the refactored code took approximately .07 seconds. Even though this is a relatively small improvement, it would become more significant as the dataset increased. The refactored timestamp screenshots can be found:

- ![2018] (https://github.com/awolfe95/Stock-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

## Summary

### There are advantages and disadvantages to refactoring code, including: 
-	Refactoring code can gain efficiencies in the time it takes to run the code. There can also be less possibilities for error as well as making the code easier to read. 
-	One disadvantage is the time it takes to look for efficiencies and rewrite code; however, the benefits in the long run can be significant. 
-	For this VBA challenge, refactoring the code did make the script run faster, thus allowing for more stocks to be analyzed in the future.
